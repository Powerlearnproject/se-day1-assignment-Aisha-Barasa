Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a process of modelling a software.
Software engineering is important since it is the backbone of modern software development ensuring that applications are high quality, cost-effective, scalable, secure and user-friendly.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering has led to the creation of Operating systems such as Windows, macOs. Web applications such as Facebook and Google. Mobile applications such as Instagram And Embedded systems such as Automotive software and IOT devices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Project planning, risk analysis, cost estimation
Requirements Analysis- Requirements gathering, database design, user interface design and technical specifications.
Desigh - System Architecture design, user interface design, database design
Implematation - Coding, unit testing
Testing - Unit testing, Integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing
Deployment
Maintenance - Bug fixes, performance enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methology involves a step to step approach where requirements are set upfront, and changes are difficult to make later.An ezample would be a government project. 
Agile methology develops the software in small, repeated cycles allowing for continuous feedback and improvements.An example would be a Startup.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The Software developer is responsible for designing, coding and implementing software applications.
The Quality Assuarance engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards and is free from defects before it is released to the users.
The project manager oversees the entire project, ensuring it is completed on time, within scope and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs increase productivity and efficiency providing an integrated environment for coding, debugging, testing. Example include Visual Studio and PyCharm.
VCS ensures smooth collaboration, traccks code changes and safeguards the projects history. Example include Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complexity of projects which can be overcome by breaking the project down into smaller manageable components and staying updated with the latest tools and technologies.
Balancing multiple tasks and meeting deadlines which can be overcome by prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance.
Debugging and trouble shooting which can be overcome by using a systematic approach to fix a bug.
Burnout and stress which can be overcome by prioritizing a healthy work life balance and setting boundaries and taking regular breaks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual components in isolation.
Integration testing tests the interaction between integrated components or modules.
System testing tests complete integrated system as a whole
Acceptance testing tests the software against business requirements to ensure it is ready for users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs for AI modules to guide them in producing the desired output.
The importance include:
Improve response quality
Tailors AI behaviour for specific tasks


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Tell me about computers
Improvesd prompt - Explain the revolution of computers in the last ten years.
The improved prompt is effective because it gives the AI clear instructions, leading to a more precise and useful answer.
